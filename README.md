# spacetagram

Search and save your favorite NASA photos

A simple search web app, utilizing NASA's image API (https://api.nasa.gov)

Uses Django to store favorited status in a persistent storage. See it live on https://spacetagram.xyz. When the user
searches for images, the red heart underneath will indicate that they or someone else using the app had favorited or
unfavorited (white heart) the photo.

Uses poetry, but also contains a requiremnts.txt, with an additional app needed, whitenoise
(http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/) for serving static files.
